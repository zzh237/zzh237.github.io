### Who am I

My name is Zach Zhang, a MS CS student in Georgia Tech. My specialization is <b>Machine Learning</b> and <b>Computational Perception</b>.

<br />

Before that, I was a full time Data Scientist for <a href="http://www.seluxdx.com/">SeLux Diagnostics Inc</a>, a biotechnology company, where the team were building 
the next generation high throughput FDA required antibiotic susceptibility testing (“AST”) device for clinical labs to run AST test for infectious disease efficiently
and precisely. Quite amount of data were generated from bio-experiments, chemical-experiments, device running, patient samples, I used <b>OOP</b> to capture those information 
from various objects such as physical device parameter, microbiological plates incubation result, chemical reagents fluorescence value, bacterial genra, 
drug concentration, patient record, then built their relationship, and then developed and applied machine learning algorithms (<b>Kernel Bayes, XGB, hmm, Bayes nets with Chow-Liu algorithm, conditional random fields, 
and deep learning LSTM</b>) to do different predication, such as minimum antibiotic susceptible concentration for different sample, and built a multi-functional software 
to embed the algorithms into the system of device for seamlessly device running and <b>algorithm training, testing, and web-visualization</b> using the <b>multi-threads pipe</b> and 
<b>ASP.NET web service</b> to communicate data between device, database, and algorithm development platform (such as python, tensorflow, Matlab, R)<a href="https://github.com/zzh237/SeLux">(github).</a>


### Career Goal

I was original studying Agricultural related science in University of Kentucky and China Agricultural University. At the same time, I have sincere love for math, programming, and engineering, so I worked severl years as Data Scientist and Engineer in the industry, now I am pursuing the Computer Science master degree in Georgia Tech, I should be thankful that I have learned math and programming well in college and during my years of working experience, and I met computer science when I was at the lowest point of my life. I hope I can further develop solid skills in this field, enjoy every step of learning. 

<br />

With the help from MOOC, I was able to quickly catch up. I have done a good number of elementary machine learning, deep learning, artificial intelligence and data science projects indepedently. So I would like to challenge myself more by doing some state-of-art machine learning and artificial intelligence researches. I am currently seeking machine learning and artificial intelligence research opportunities not only in the Georgia Tech but also in the other areas in the United States.

### Course Projects

Georgia Tech’s CS7641 ML class has four fairly involved projects. <a href ="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1CKulfMYYOr_cs86v48-KcSf8QiytfbHO">supervised learning</a>,    
<a href ="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1jMAsi-wVYdruQQTWWGKeoFV9NzBmCvda">randomized optimization</a>, 
<a href ="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1ywQx8xkWuFNqYK2NYOw2Pdddl9NkRLVP">unsupervised learning</a>, and 
<a href ="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1cd3hXTwb1pvLT8AO-PiUOTGLStOIsDBA">Markov Decision Processes</a>. 

<br />

Computer Vision project: 
Activity classification using MHI: In class project, I classified different human movements behavior by training video data containing multiple human movements, 
using the motion history image stack to represent the video data, performed background subtraction, motion history images moments calculation, 
and applied different classifiers to train the image moments, then predicated the human behavior from real-world video [<a href ="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1bePGRlxUlnrkpv3T5gDZI4h4d5zAr9bv">PDF</a>].  

<br />

AI for Robotics project:
Simulated Intelligent Robot Tracking Agent: in course project, I developed a naive intelligent agent to predict the future trajectory of a Nano robot’s dynamic moving position; 
evaluated multiple training algorithms in Bayesian probabilistic model, linear-Gaussian model (Kalman Filters), sequential Monte Carlo simulation (particle filters), 
residual learning model; reduced video data dimensionality by PCA; tuned residual neural network hyperparameters 
and applied bootstrap aggregation with multiple residual neural networks [<a href ="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1h349nlaTj-p_aJAxRO1wWl6PvWtd7ose">PDF</a>].

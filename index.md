### About
---
I am a doctoral student in computer science, working on problems related to statistics, optimization, and machine learning.  
<br />
<!-- In particular, the problems are related to statistical machine learning, high-dimensional statistics, computational statistics, statistical inference and estimation of dynamic systems. 
 -->
<!-- I am always highly interested in the statistical inference, estimation, and learning of dynamic systems and their relationship with reinforcement learning algorithms. 
statistical learning theory for explaining and analyzing how the deep neural network model works
I also care about heath. I worked 2 years as Data Scientist and Engineer in Harvard Medical School and other research position.  -->


<!-- Last two years, I just got my master's degree in statistics from the [University of California, Davis, department of statistics](https://statistics.ucdavis.edu/), and two years ago, I obtained my master's degree in computer science from Georgia Institute of Technology, where I was in school of [Computational Science and Engineering](https://cse.gatech.edu/).  -->

Last two years, I just got my master's degree in statistics from the [University of California, Davis, department of statistics](https://statistics.ucdavis.edu/), where I was studying one favorite course high dimensional statistics by [Prof. Miles Lopes](https://anson.ucdavis.edu/~melopes/), and doing an independent study with [Prof. Xiucai Ding](https://xcding1212.github.io/), and two years ago, I obtained my master's degree in computer science from Georgia Institute of Technology, where I was in [Computational Science and Engineering](https://cse.gatech.edu/) and my advisor was [Prof. Hongyuan Zha](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/~zha/). 

<br />

Facing enormous math knowledge, I am always humbled to learn. You can find the [courses](course_summary.txt) I studied and am interested in. 

<!-- I finished the Computer Science master degree in Georgia Tech specialized with <b>Machine Learning, where I worked on the multi-agent reinforcement learning research.
At the same time, I have sincere love for math, programming, and engineering, and automation, so I continue to strengthen my mathematics learning through advanced courses and research.

<h3>Short Bio</h3>
<p>My name is Zach Zhang, a MS CS student in Georgia Tech. 
   My specialization is <b>Machine Learning</b> and <b>Computational Perception</b>.
<hr>   
<p>Before that, I was a full time Data Scientist for <a href="http://www.seluxdx.com/">SeLux Diagnostics Inc</a>, a biotechnology company, where the team were building 
   the next generation high throughput FDA required antibiotic susceptibility testing (“AST”) device for clinical labs to run AST test for infectious disease efficiently
   and precisely. Quite amount of data were generated from bio-experiments, chemical-experiments, device running, patient samples, I used <b>OOP</b> to capture those information 
   from various objects such as physical device parameter, microbiological plates incubation result, chemical reagents fluorescence value, bacterial genra, 
   drug concentration, patient record, then built their relationship, and then developed and applied machine learning algorithms (<b>Kernel Bayes, XGB, hmm, Bayes nets with Chow-Liu algorithm, conditional random fields, 
   and deep learning LSTM</b>) to do different predication, such as minimum antibiotic susceptible concentration for different sample, and built a multi-functional software 
   to embed the algorithms into the system of device for seamlessly device running and <b>algorithm training, testing, and web-visualization</b> using the <b>multi-threads pipe</b> and 
   <b>ASP.NET web service</b> to communicate data between device, database, and algorithm development platform (such as python, tensorflow, Matlab, R)<a href="https://github.com/zzh237/SeLux">(github).</a>

<h3>Course Projects</h3>
<p> Georgia Tech’s CS7641 ML class has four fairly involved projects. <a href ="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1CKulfMYYOr_cs86v48-KcSf8QiytfbHO">supervised learning</a>,    
<a href ="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1jMAsi-wVYdruQQTWWGKeoFV9NzBmCvda">randomized optimization</a>, 
<a href ="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1ywQx8xkWuFNqYK2NYOw2Pdddl9NkRLVP">unsupervised learning</a>, and 
<a href ="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1cd3hXTwb1pvLT8AO-PiUOTGLStOIsDBA">Markov Decision Processes</a>. 

<p> Computer Vision project: 
Activity classification using MHI: In class project, I classified different human movements behavior by training video data containing multiple human movements, 
using the motion history image stack to represent the video data, performed background subtraction, motion history images moments calculation, 
and applied different classifiers to train the image moments, then predicated the human behavior from real-world video [<a href ="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1bePGRlxUlnrkpv3T5gDZI4h4d5zAr9bv">PDF</a>].  

<p> AI for Robotics project:
Simulated Intelligent Robot Tracking Agent: in course project, I developed a naive intelligent agent to predict the future trajectory of a Nano robot’s dynamic moving position; 
evaluated multiple training algorithms in Bayesian probabilistic model, linear-Gaussian model (Kalman Filters), sequential Monte Carlo simulation (particle filters), 
residual learning model; reduced video data dimensionality by PCA; tuned residual neural network hyperparameters 
and applied bootstrap aggregation with multiple residual neural networks [<a href ="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1h349nlaTj-p_aJAxRO1wWl6PvWtd7ose">PDF</a>].

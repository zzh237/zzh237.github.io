  <p align="justify">&#8226 I will work as a <strong>Machine Learning Research Intern</strong> at Technicolor Artificial Intelligence Lab at Palo Alto in the summer of 2018.</p>

	<p align="justify">&#8226 I worked as the <strong>Chief Strategy Officer</strong> and <strong>Research Data Scientist</strong> in Driving-Force Therapeutics, a pharmaceutical start-up in Dalian, China, from 2016 to 2017, focusing on experiment strategic plan and biostatistical data analysis.</p>

	<p align="justify">&#8226 I am currently a <strong>master</strong> student in the Department of Computer Science at the <strong>University of Chicago</strong>.</p>
	<p align="justify">&#8226 I got a <strong>M.Sc.</strong> degree in <strong>Biochemistry</strong> with a certificate of <strong>Structural Biology and Biophysics</strong> froom <strong>Duke University</strong> in 2016, and a <strong>B.Sc.</strong> degree in<strong> Biotechnology</strong> with a certificate of <strong>Mathematical Modeling</strong> from <strong>Dalian University of Technology</strong> in 2012.</p>
	<p align="justify">&#8226 I was a <strong>PhD candidate</strong> at the Department of Biochemistry at Duke University, working on DNA repair mechanisms. I did not get my luck, and was extremely unhappy there. So I decided to leave Duke to do the right thing in my life in 2016.</p>

	<p align="center" class=bottom-small><img src="{{ site.url }}/images/CV/001-medal.png" alt="Honors and Awards" width="70" height="70" style="padding:5px;"></p>
	<p align="justify">&#8226 I had independently won a good number of awards in domestic and international methematical modeling contests (which are team contests), including <a href="http://en.mcm.edu.cn/" target="_blank"><strong>CUMCM</strong></a> (Contemporary Undergraduate Mathematical Contest in Modeling) and <a href="http://www.comap.com/undergraduate/contests/" target="_blank"><strong>MCM/ICM</strong></a> (Mathematical Contest in Modeling/The Interdisciplinary Contest in Modeling), when I was an undergraduate student majored in Biotechnology in China.</p>
	<p align="justify">&#8226 I had been taking different levels of <strong>Mathematical Olympiad</strong> for decades since my childhood. But I have only won a second prize once in a regional college-level domestic regional competition. Purhaps I am not that talented in Math.</p>
	<p align="justify">&#8226 I had been awarded almost all the top honors and scholarships, including <strong>President's List</strong> and <strong>National Scholarship</strong> three years in a row, when I was in college. But I only won an <strong>Outstanding Research Poster Award</strong> in the Biochemistry Deparment Retreat despite my four-year effort at Duke University, right before my termination from Duke in 2016.</p>

    <p align="justify">&#8226 <strong>Logo</strong> (I called it <strong>Turtle</strong>) is the first programming language that I learned when I was a third-year primary-school student in 2000.</p>
	<p align="justify">&#8226 I could program using <strong>Python</strong>, <strong>C/C++</strong>, <strong>MATLAB</strong> and <strong>R</strong>, which are listed in a decreasing order of proficiency.</p>
	<p align="justify">&#8226 I learned Python in 2015 and I think it is the most beautiful programming language in the world. I use Python for most of my <strong>machine learning</strong>,  <strong>artificial intelligence</strong> and <strong>data science</strong> studies.</p>
	<p align="justify">&#8226 I know little about HTML/CSS language. I made my websites based on others' templates, and revised them using my programming common sense and Google.</p>

## Warp Execution

All threads of a warp are executed by the SIMD hardware as a bundle, where the same instruction is run for all threads.

Warp is the unit of thread scheduling in SMs.

### when is it good?

When all threads within a warp follow the same control flow.

For example, for an if-else construct, the execution works well when either all threads execute the if part or all execute the else part.

### when is it bad?

When threads within a warp take different control flow paths, the SIMD hardware will take *multiple passes* through these divergent paths. During each pass, the threads that follow the other path are not allowed to take effect.

These passes are *sequential* to each other, thus they will add to the execution time.

Bayes Nets with Chow-Liu to do multi-classification of photos: I collected data from instagram photos of five national parks. I then trained up a classifier that correctly predicts the park from a photo. This is a non-trivial task, since naive approach -- using each pixel as a feature -- will fail. To see why consider the two photos below.

Landmark occurs in both photos but not in the same position in the image. Further due to the opening in the arch, middle of the photo may be occupied by sky or rock. At best, treating pixels as feature I can analyze image in terms of color frequencies -- how intense are the red, green and blue channel.

Instead of using each pixel as a feature, I used features -- computed by a neural network -- which aggregate information about edges, shapes, and color intensities across the whole image to do prediction.
I trained a prediction model which takes distilled representation of the photos, 1000 features per picture, and predicts where the photo was taken. 
I modeled features in the dataset using Bayesian networks, one for each class -- natural park. I implement learning of the tree structure for each class using Chow-Liu algorithm, then
I used the tree structure to learn parameters for conditional probabilities associated with edges in these trees, then 
I computed probability of a feature vector xx in each of the five Bayesian networks, then I computed probabilities that the feature vector xx belongs to each class, then I made predictions based on probabilities and explored prediction performance.

### Introduction

Simulated Intelligent Robot Tracking Agent: in course project, I developed a naive intelligent agent to predict the future trajectory of a Nano robotâ€™s dynamic moving position; 
evaluated multiple training algorithms in Bayesian probabilistic model, linear-Gaussian model (Kalman Filters), sequential Monte Carlo simulation (particle filters), 
residual learning model; reduced video data dimensionality by PCA; tuned residual neural network hyperparameters 
and applied bootstrap aggregation with multiple residual neural networks [<a href ="https://github.com/zzh237/cs8803-AI4R">Github</a>][<a href ="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1h349nlaTj-p_aJAxRO1wWl6PvWtd7ose">PDF</a>].

### Description

This API could add pattern features learned by Google DeepDream to your paintings. 

<br />

The development of this API is still in progress. More functions will be added in the future.

### Requirements

* Python 3.6

### Dependencies

* tensorflow 1.3
* numpy
* PIL
* os
* sys
* zipfile
* six
* argparse

### Usage

Here I am using Georges Seurat's "Sunday Afternoon On The Island Of La Grande Jatte" as an example to illustrate the usage of this Google DeepDream API.

#### List the available layers and the number of channels

To check the available layer names and channel numbers for the deepdream program. 

<br />

**Input**

{% highlight shell %}
python deepdream_api.py -l
{% endhighlight %}

**Output**
{% highlight shell %}
import/conv2d0_pre_relu/conv 64
import/conv2d1_pre_relu/conv 64
import/conv2d2_pre_relu/conv 192
import/mixed3a_1x1_pre_relu/conv 64
import/mixed3a_3x3_bottleneck_pre_relu/conv 96
import/mixed3a_3x3_pre_relu/conv 128
import/mixed3a_5x5_bottleneck_pre_relu/conv 16
import/mixed3a_5x5_pre_relu/conv 32
import/mixed3a_pool_reduce_pre_relu/conv 32
import/mixed3b_1x1_pre_relu/conv 128
import/mixed3b_3x3_bottleneck_pre_relu/conv 128
import/mixed3b_3x3_pre_relu/conv 192
import/mixed3b_5x5_bottleneck_pre_relu/conv 32
...
{% endhighlight %}
In the output, the layer name is on the left, the number of channels in the layer is on the right.


#### Preview the feature pattern of the neural network

To preview the feature pattern learned in a certain channel of a certain layer in the neural network. This is helpful for the user to select layers and channels used for image modification. While not cessary, you may also preview all the feature patterns learned in the neural network [here](http://storage.googleapis.com/deepdream/visualz/tensorflow_inception/index.html). It should be noted that the high frequencies of the patterns might have been suppressed by Laplacian pyramid decomposition in those images.

<br />

**Input**

<br />

-p layer_name channel_number, --preview layer_name channel_number

{% highlight shell %}
python deepdream_api.py -p mixed4b_1x1_pre_relu 70 pattern.jpeg
{% endhighlight %}

**Output**

#### Preview the feature pattern of the neural network

To preview the feature pattern learned in a certain channel of a certain layer in the neural network with Laplacian Pyramid Gradient Normalization. High frequency patterns were suppressed by Laplacian Pyramid Gradient Normalization.

<br />

It should be noted that the feature No.70 in "mixed4b_1x1_pre_relu" layer I generated in this example is almost the same to the [one](http://storage.googleapis.com/deepdream/visualz/tensorflow_inception/mixed4b_1x1_pre_relu.html) archieved in Google's server.

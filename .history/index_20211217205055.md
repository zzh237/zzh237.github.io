<!-- ### Who am I 
You can also see my webpage [scholoar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=O__axAoAAAAJ&hl=en).
 -->
I am a doctoral student in computer science, working on problems related to statistics, optimization, and machine learning.  

<!-- In particular, the problems are related to statistical machine learning, high-dimensional statistics, computational statistics, statistical inference and estimation of dynamic systems. 
 -->
<!-- I am always highly interested in the statistical inference, estimation, and learning of dynamic systems and their relationship with reinforcement learning algorithms. 
statistical learning theory for explaining and analyzing how the deep neural network model works
I also care about heath. I worked 2 years as Data Scientist and Engineer in Harvard Medical School and other research position.  -->


Last two years, I just got my master's degree in statistics from the University of California, Davis, where I was fortunate studying one favorite course high dimensional statistics by Prof. Miles Lopes, and working with Prof. Xiucaiding, and two years ago, I obtained my master's degree in computer science from Georgia Institute of Technology, where I was in computational science and engineering and my advisor was Prof. Hongyuan Zha. 

<!-- I finished the Computer Science master degree in Georgia Tech specialized with <b>Machine Learning, where I worked on the multi-agent reinforcement learning research.
At the same time, I have sincere love for math, programming, and engineering, and automation, so I continue to strengthen my mathematics learning through advanced courses and research.

<!-- #### Data Engineering and web visualization: 
I was a full time Senior Data Scientist for <a href="http://www.seluxdx.com/">SeLux Diagnostics Inc</a>, a biotechnology company, where the team are building 
the next generation high throughput FDA required antibiotic susceptibility testing (“AST”) device for clinical labs to run AST test for infectious disease efficiently
and precisely. Quite amount of data were generated from bio-experiments, chemical-experiments, device running, patient samples, I used <b>OOP</b> to capture those information 
from various objects such as physical device parameters, incubation results of microbiological plates, chemical reagents fluorescence value, bacterial genera, 
drug concentration, patients' record, then investigated their relationship, and then developed and applied machine learning algorithms (<b>Kernel Bayes, XGB, hmm, Bayes nets with Chow-Liu tree, conditional random fields, 
and deep learning LSTM</b>) to do different predication, such as minimum antibiotic susceptible concentration for different sample, and built a multi-functional software 
to embed the algorithms into the system of device for seamlessly backend device running and <b>algorithm training, testing, and frontend web-visualization</b> using the <b>multi-threads pipe</b> and 
<b>ASP.NET web service</b> to communicate data between device, database, and algorithm development platform (such as python, tensorflow, Matlab, R)<a href="https://github.com/zzh237/SeLux">(github).</a>

- Computer Vision 

Activity classification using MHI: In class project, I classified different human movements behavior by training video data containing multiple human movements, 
using the motion history image stack to represent the video data, performed background subtraction, motion history images moments calculation, 
and applied different classifiers to train the image moments, then predicated the human behavior from real-world video [<a href ="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1bePGRlxUlnrkpv3T5gDZI4h4d5zAr9bv">PDF</a>].

Bayes Nets with Chow-Liu to do multi-classification of photos: I collected data from instagram photos of five national parks. I then trained up a classifier that correctly predicts the park from a photo. This is a non-trivial task, since naive approach -- using each pixel as a feature -- will fail. To see why consider the two photos below.
<figure>
  <img src="/images/projects/bn-chowliu/intro.PNG" width="304" height="180">  
</figure>
Landmark occurs in both photos but not in the same position in the image. Further due to the opening in the arch, middle of the photo may be occupied by sky or rock. At best, treating pixels as feature I can analyze image in terms of color frequencies -- how intense are the red, green and blue channel.

Instead of using each pixel as a feature, I used features -- computed by a neural network -- which aggregate information about edges, shapes, and color intensities across the whole image to do prediction.
I trained a prediction model which takes distilled representation of the photos, 1000 features per picture, and predicts where the photo was taken. 
I modeled features in the dataset using Bayesian networks, one for each class -- natural park. I implement learning of the tree structure for each class using Chow-Liu algorithm, then
I used the tree structure to learn parameters for conditional probabilities associated with edges in these trees, then 
I computed probability of a feature vector xx in each of the five Bayesian networks, then I computed probabilities that the feature vector xx belongs to each class, then I made predictions based on probabilities and explored prediction performance.
